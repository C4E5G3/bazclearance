## Who We Are  

We are a core team of two, myself Baz, and Marcus. You can see us in the pictures, or on Facebook by clicking the Facebook social icon in the footer.
We both have considerable experience doing courier work running things round the country, (you can see my Shiply profile in the icons), and now 
we operate locally - rather than running all over the country - doing house clearances. We are both extremely professional and conscientious about
our work, which I hope shows in our reviews.  

My normal practice is to come out and inspect the potential job with you, obviously discussing with you all the specific requirements and key factors of the job,
and then to give you a quote and a timeframe. Some people have strict deadlines, some people don't need the job done until after probate, sometimes there
are important items that need to be found, sometimes there are specific items that need to be delivered elsewhere, sometimes there is essential paperwork that needs 
to be preserved, and so forth.

Me and Marcus both have a very strong work ethic, and enjoy helping people. I was a builder before injuring myself. I have been couriering & moving things for 20 years now, 
& I am very dependable. You can click [here to see my Shiply courier reviews.](https://www.shiply.com/transport-provider/bazthevan)Lots of jobs are standard, some are different. Sometimes we have clients who are coping with a 
bereavement, some clients are coming from distance and are maybe putting an elderly relative into a care home. Whatever the circumstances, we strive to facilitate 
the process for you. 

We possess several professional storage units, and are able to store and hold any large items you might want to keep for later use. We service the whole of Dorset, 
but can also work in neighbouring counties.

Oh by the way, we are very careful in our work, and we do our utmost not to leave your property with any nasty dings, dents and scrapes!!

Catch up with us on social media if you like - We have a Facebook page, My Shiply reviews, and A Youtube channel is in the works.
