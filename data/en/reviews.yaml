  description:  The amazing Baz! I called him to dispose of my sofas. He said they were to good to dump and contacted a friend of his who recycles sofas supporting a charity in Ghana. Baz said he would forego making his money when the sofas could be used elsewhere. It's not often you find an honest superstar like him. What a man!
