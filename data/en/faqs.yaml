- title: Job Specification
  faqs:
    - question: Will the house clearance take everything?
      answer: Absolutely. Other than fixtures and fittings, and prohibited substances, yes. Our service will be a complete clearance. In the case of fixtures, we may also be able to remove them however.   
    - question: I only need a few items moving....
      answer: No problem whatsoever. We can move individual items. 
    - question: The tenant has left us a complete bomb-site. Can you come in and put it to rights? 
      answer: Of course. The only situation where we will turn down a job is in the case of a serious health risk.
    - question: Do I need to be on site for the clearance?
      answer: Not at all. Just meet us there or arrange the keys with us beforehand, that is all that is required. 
    - question: Is there anything you don't move?
      answer: Hazardous products are outside our scope I am afraid -- gas, oil, propane tanks, toxic materials, chemicals and asbestos.
    - question: We've been given probate - can you locate important documentation? 
      answer: 100%. If for whatever reason you need something important unearthed, we will look out for it, and in the case of documentation, we handle all paperwork carefully. 
- title: Settling Up
  faqs:
    - question: How much does it cost to clear a house? 
      answer: Our work is normally in the £500-£2500 range. However the job involves several variables -- the volume of goods, the size of the property, the access to the property, the number of floors in the property, any garden and outbuildings, the state of the property, any unusual or very large items, the type and quantity of goods for the waste centre, and the time window for the job, to name the key considerations. We also factor in goods that we can subtract as collateral value. But nothing is as precise as a simple quote....   
    - question: I need an exact price before you come round....
      answer: We can give you a ball-park figure on the phone, but a proper quotes require us to visit the site. 
    - question: How do we pay you?
      answer:  We accept Cash or BACS Transfer, and provide you with an invoice.
    - question: What is your complaints policy?
      answer: In the event of a problem, the onus is heavily on us to rectify the situation. We strongly advise clients therefore to inspect a property as soon as convenient after a clearance. As we are honest, reasonable and responsible traders, we would have alerted you already if we were aware of an issue.  
- title: Miscellaneous
  faqs:
    - question: Do you recycle?
      answer: Yes, absolutely. We have an informal contract with a local charity who pick up everything that can be reused. We also have neighbours who enjoy boot sales, so even if we are too busy to go, they will sift the detritus for things with a life. The rest goes to waste disposal, who recycle 90% of what they receive. 
    - question: Are you licensed to dispose of waste?
      answer: Yes - see the box below for our registration details
