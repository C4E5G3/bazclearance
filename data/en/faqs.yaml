- title: Job Specification
  faqs:
    - question: The tenant has left us a complete bomb-site. Can you come in and put it to rights? 
      answer: Of course. The only situation where we will turn down a job is in the case of a serious health risk.
    - question: Do I need to be on site for the clearance?
      answer: Not at all. Just meet us there or arrange the keys with us beforehand, that is all that is required. 
    - question: Is there anything you don't move?
      answer: Hazardous products are outside our scope I am afraid -- gas, oil, propane tanks, toxic materials, chemicals and asbestos.
    - question: I only need a few items moving....
      answer: No problem whatsoever. We can move individual items. 
    - question: We've been given probate - can you locate important documentation? 
      answer: 100%. If for whatever reason you need something important unearthed, we will look out for it, and in the case of documentation, we handle all paperwork carefully. 
- title: Settling Up
  faqs:
    - question: How do we pay you?
      answer:  We accept Cash or BACS Transfer, and provide you with an invoice.
    - question: I need an exact price before you come round....
      answer: Unfortunately the job involves variables -- volume of goods, access to property, floors of property, state of property, type and quantity of goods for waste centre -- We can give you a ball-park figure on the phone, but proper quotes require us visiting the site. 
    - question: What is your complaints policy?
      answer: In the event of a problem, the onus is heavily on us to rectify the situation. We strongly advise clients therefore to inspect a property as soon as convenient after a clearance. As we are honest, reasonable and responsible traders, we would have alerted you already if we were aware of an issue.  
- title: Miscellaneous
  faqs:
    - question: Do you recycle?
      answer: Yes, absolutely. We have an informal contract with a local charity who pick up everything that can be reused. We also have neighbours who enjoy boot sales, so even if we are too busy to go, they will sift the detritus for things with a life. The rest goes to waste disposal, who recycle 90% of what they receive. 
    - question: Are you licensed to dispose of waste?
      answer: Yes - see the box below for our registration details
